# 🗣️ Peer Interview Guide — MyStrivera Mock (Data Analysis Using Pandas)

### 🎯 Purpose
To simulate a **real data analysis interview** using Python & Pandas, focusing on cleaning, aggregation, and analytical reasoning.

---

## 🧩 How to Conduct the Interview
1. **Send the candidate the data (`sales_data.csv`) and question (`interview_question.md`)**.  
2. Allow 30 minutes total:
   - 5 min: Overview and clarification
   - 20 min: Hands-on coding + reasoning
   - 5 min: Discussion and reflection

---

## 🪄 Using ChatGPT as Assistant
If the candidate gets stuck, you can attach the data, question, and solution files in ChatGPT and use this prompt:

```
You are ChatGPT, assisting a peer to conduct a live mock interview for a data analyst role.
I will share the dataset, question, and reference solution.
- Do NOT reveal answers.
- Give hints only when the candidate is stuck.
- Ask guiding questions like:
  - “Have you checked for duplicates or missing values?”
  - “What would happen if you multiplied quantity and price?”
  - “Can you group the data by category or store?”
Encourage structured thinking, not memorization.
```
