# About the Dataset

### Context
You are working as a data analyst for a yacht and boat sales website. The marketing team is preparing a weekly newsletter for boat owners. The newsletter is designed to help sellers to get more views of their boat, as well as stay on top of market trends.

They would like me to take a look at the recent data and get some insights. The possible questions that we can ask ourselves is:

- characteristics of the most viewed boat listings in the last 7 days
- is it the most expensive boats that get the most views?
- Are there common features among the most viewed boats?
