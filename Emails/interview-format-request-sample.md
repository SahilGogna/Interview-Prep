**Subject:** Interview Preparation — Product Data Analyst

Hi Maya,

Thank you for scheduling the interview for the **Product Data Analyst** role at **BlueSky FinTech**. I’m excited about the opportunity to speak with the team.

To make sure I prepare effectively, could you please share what format the interview will follow (for example, technical questions, case study, live coding/SQL, or behavioral)? If there are any materials or areas you recommend reviewing beforehand, I’d appreciate the guidance.

Thanks again, and I’m looking forward to the conversation.

Best regards,
