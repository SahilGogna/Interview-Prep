# Excel Mock Interview — Instructions

## 1. Setup
- Pick a problem folder (e.g., `Excel Problem 1/`).
- Import the `data.csv` file into Microsoft Excel.
- Keep the `problem.md` file open — you'll be asking these to your peer.

---

## 2. Running the Interview
- Each peer gets **30 minutes**.
- The candidate should:
  - Explore the data first (check columns, data types, missing values).
  - Create visualizations to support their analysis.
  - Explain their thinking step by step.
  - Use Excel features like PivotTables, charts, and formulas.

---

## 3. If Your Peer Gets Stuck
- Don't give away the answer right away.
- Use this prompt with an AI assistant:

**Prompt to paste:**
```
I am conducting a peer Excel interview.

Here is the question:
<QUESTION>

The dataset contains these columns:
<LIST COLUMNS>

Please give me **hints only**, not the full solution.
- Suggest which columns to analyze.
- Recommend Excel features (PivotTable, VLOOKUP, charts).
- Give 3-4 hints that get progressively more detailed.
```

- Share these hints with your peer instead of the final answer.

---

## 4. Feedback
- End each session with:
  - One strength they showed.
  - One area to improve.
- Keep it positive and focused on learning.

That's it!  
Import data.csv → Ask the questions → Guide with hints → Give feedback.
