# Peer SQL Interview â€” Simple Instructions

## 1. Setup
- Pick a dataset (`banking` or `insurance`).
- Attach the `.sql` data file to your favorite AI assistant (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claudeâ€¦).
- Keep the `questions.md` file open â€” youâ€™ll be asking these to your peer.

---

## 2. Running the Interview
- Each peer gets **30 minutes**.
- Ask the questions in order one by one:
  - **1 â†’ Super Easy**
  - **2 â†’ Easy**
  - **3 â†’ Medium**
- Encourage your peer to:
  - Explain their thinking step by step.
  - Try even if theyâ€™re unsure â€” itâ€™s practice.

---

## 3. If Your Peer Gets Stuck
- Donâ€™t give away the solution right away.
- Copy the **question** and use this prompt with the `.sql` file in your AI tool:

**Prompt to paste:**
```
I am conducting a peer SQL interview.

Here is the question:
<QUESTION>

The schema is attached as a .sql file.

Please give me **hints only**, not the full solution.
- Break the problem into smaller steps.
- Point to the right tables/columns.
- Suggest SQL concepts (JOIN, GROUP BY, filters).
- Give 3â€“4 hints that get progressively more detailed.
```

- Share these hints with your peer instead of the final query.  
- Show them the **solutions file** only if theyâ€™re still completely stuck.

## 4. Feedback
- End each session with:
  - âœ… One strength they showed.
  - ðŸ”§ One area to improve.
- Keep it positive and focused on learning.
