# Interview Preparation Guide for MyStrivera Community

Welcome, MyStrivera community members! This guide is designed to help you prepare for your 
upcoming mock interviews, covering the typical rounds you can expect in a technical hiring 
process: Screening, Behavioral, and Technical. While the sample questions provided are 
general, they offer a solid foundation for your preparation. Remember to always tailor your 
answers and preparation to the specific Job  

## The Screening Round

The screening round is typically the first stage of the interview process, often conducted by a 
recruiter or a hiring manager. Its primary purpose is to quickly assess your fundamental 
qualifications, interest in the role, and alignment with the company culture. It’s a chance for the 
company to filter out candidates who do not meet basic requirements before investing more 
time in detailed interviews. 

### Purpose of the Screening Round
- To verify basic qualifications, skills, and experience against the JD. 
- To understand your career aspirations and fit with the role/company. 
- To discuss salary expectations and availability. 
- To gauge your communication skills and enthusiasm. 

### Sample Screening Questions (General)
- "Tell me about yourself / Walk me through your resume." (This is your elevator pitch – 
highlight relevant experience and skills that align with the JD). 
- "What attracted you to this role / our company?" (Demonstrate you've researched the 
company and the specific JD). 
- "What are your key strengths and weaknesses?" (Be honest but frame weaknesses as 
areas for growth). 
- "Why are you looking to leave your current role?" (Focus on growth opportunities rather 
than negatives). 
- "What are your salary expectations?" (Be prepared with a realistic range for the role and 
your experience). 
- "Do you have any questions for me?" (Always have thoughtful questions prepared to 
show your engagement). 

## The Behavioral Round

The behavioral round aims to understand how you have handled specific situations in the past, 
as past behavior is often a predictor of future performance. Interviewers will use questions that 
prompt you to describe challenges, actions you took, and the results. The STAR/CURL method 
is highly recommended for structuring your answers. 

### Purpose of the Behavioral Round
- To evaluate soft skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, leadership, communication, and 
adaptability. 
- To understand your work style, ethics, and ability to handle pressure or conflict. 
- To assess cultural fit within the team and company. 

### Sample Behavioral Questions (General)
- "Tell me about a time you faced a significant challenge in a project. How did you 
overcome it?" 
- "Describe a situation where you had to work with a difficult team member. What was the 
outcome?" 
- "Give an example of a time you failed or made a mistake. What did you learn from it?" 
- "How do you handle constructive criticism?" (Provide a specific example). 
- "Tell me about a time you had to learn a new technology quickly. How did you approach 
it?" 
- "Describe a project where you took initiative or demonstrated leadership." 
- "How do you prioritize your tasks when you have multiple deadlines?" 

## The Technical Round

The technical round evaluates your hands-on skills, problem-solving abilities, and depth of 
knowledge in areas relevant to data-focused roles. This often involves demonstrating 
proficiency in data manipulation, analysis, programming, and understanding of systems. 

### Purpose of the Technical Round
- To assess your proficiency in programming languages, data structures, algorithms, and 
relevant tools. 
- To evaluate your ability to design and implement robust, scalable, and efficient solutions. 
- To understand your approach to debugging, testing, and optimizing code. 
- To gauge your knowledge of software engineering principles and best practices. 

### Sample Technical Questions
- **SQL Proficiency & Data Retrieval**  
  "Given a scenario with multiple related tables (e.g., customer details, transactions, product information), write a SQL query to extract specific insights, such as the total sales per customer category for products purchased in the last quarter. Explain how you would handle potential null values or duplicate entries within this query."  

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
  "Describe a complex dataset you've worked with that required significant cleaning and transformation before it could be used for analysis. Outline the steps you took, the tools or languages you used (e.g., Python, SQL, Excel/VBA), and the key challenges you faced in preparing the data for analysis or integration."  

- **Python for Data Analysis & Automation**  
  "You're tasked with automating a recurring data task, such as generating a report from a raw data file or identifying anomalies in a data stream. Explain how you would approach this using Python, including the libraries you might use (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, etc.) and your considerations for error handling and scalability."  

- **Data Visualization & Reporting**  
  "How do you approach designing a data dashboard or report (using tools like Power BI or Tableau) to effectively communicate complex insights to non-technical stakeholders? Provide an example of a key metric you would visualise and why, considering the target audience and their potential questions."  

- **ETL and Data Pipeline Concepts**  
  "Explain the key components and considerations when designing an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for ingesting data from various sources into a data warehouse. How would you ensure data quality, reliability, and efficient processing for both batch and potentially real-time data flows?"  

- **Analytical Problem-Solving**  
  "Describe a business problem where you used data analysis to identify trends, pinpoint inefficiencies, or propose a solution. What was the specific problem, what data did you analyse, what was your key finding, and what impact did your recommendations have on the business?"
