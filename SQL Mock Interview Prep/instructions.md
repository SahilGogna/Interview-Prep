# SQL Mock Interview — Instructions

## 1. Setup
- Pick a problem folder (e.g., `SQL Problem 3/`).
- Run the `data.sql` file in your SQL client to create the schema and load sample data.
- Keep the `problem.md` file open — you'll be asking these to your peer.

---

## 2. Running the Interview

**Total Time: 1 hour**
- 5 min — Session intro
- 50 min — Interview (25 min per peer)
- 5 min — Wrap up

Each peer gets **25 minutes**. Ask 2-3 questions, mixing difficulty levels:
  - **Easy** → Warm-up (5-10 min)
  - **Medium** → Main challenge (15 min)
- Encourage your peer to:
  - Explain their thinking step by step.
  - Ask clarifying questions about the schema.
  - Try even if they're unsure — it's practice.

---

## 3. If Your Peer Gets Stuck
- Don't give away the solution right away.
- Copy the **question** and use this prompt with the `data.sql` file in your AI tool:

**Prompt to paste:**
```
I am conducting a peer SQL interview.

Here is the question:
<QUESTION>

The schema is attached as a .sql file.

Please give me **hints only**, not the full solution.
- Break the problem into smaller steps.
- Point to the right tables/columns.
- Suggest SQL concepts (JOIN, GROUP BY, window functions).
- Give 3–4 hints that get progressively more detailed.
```

- Share these hints with your peer instead of the final query.
- Show them the **solutions file** only if they're still completely stuck.

---

## 4. Feedback
- End each session with:
  - One strength they showed.
  - One area to improve.
- Keep it positive and focused on learning.

That's it!  
Run data.sql → Ask the questions → Guide with hints → Give feedback.
