## 🎯 How to Practice Solo

1. Open a problem folder (e.g., `SQL Problem 3/`)
2. Read `problem.md` for the question and context
3. Use `data.sql` to set up your database
4. Write your solution in your preferred SQL editor
5. Check `SQL Solutions/solution_X.md` when done

## 👥 Peer Interview Format

### Setup (5 min)
- **Interviewer**: Pick 2-3 problems (mix of Easy & Medium)
- **Candidate**: Have SQL editor ready
- Share `data.sql` with candidate for schema setup

### Interview (30 min)
1. Ask questions one at a time
2. Encourage candidate to:
   - Explain their thinking step by step
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Try even if unsure — it's practice!

### If Candidate Gets Stuck
Use this prompt with an AI assistant:

```
I am conducting a peer SQL interview.

Here is the question:
<PASTE QUESTION HERE>

The schema is in the attached data.sql file.

Please give me **hints only**, not the full solution:
- Break the problem into smaller steps
- Point to the right tables/columns
- Suggest SQL concepts (JOIN, GROUP BY, window functions)
- Give 3-4 hints that get progressively more detailed
```

Share these hints with the candidate before showing the full solution.
